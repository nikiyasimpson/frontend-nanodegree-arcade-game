## Instructions

To run, open index.html from any web browser. Choose from level 1-3 and choose a player. Click on Start Game to begin.

Player must get from the starting point to the water in less than 30 seconds. Collect as many stars as possible and avoid the bugs along the way.

The project has 4 different javascript files that drive the application functionality. The game has different characters including players, enemies, and stars.

All of the javaScript code is located in the js directory.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## How to Play

To play cross the road, try to move the player from the grass to the stream in less than 30 seconds. Use your up, down, left, and right arrow keys to move. On the way collect as many stars as possible while avoiding the bugs that will knock you off the path. You can choose from 3 different levels that increase the difficulty of the game. Try to beat your own time each time you play.

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
